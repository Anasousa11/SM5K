Place your wireframe and screenshot images here for README references.

Recommended filenames:
- wireframe_home.png
- homepage.png
- membership_plans.png
- events_list.png
- event_detail.png

Additional example:
- w3c_css_validation.png  # W3C CSS Validation screenshot (add image here)

When adding images, reference them in the repository README as:

![Homepage screenshot](static/img/screenshots/homepage.png)

Notes:
- Keep images reasonably small (max 1-2MB) to keep repo size manageable.
- Replace placeholder filenames with the actual exported images from your design tool.

If you have the W3C CSS validation screenshot (from the site validator), save it to:

```
static/img/screenshots/w3c_css_validation.png
```

Then reference it in the top-level README or other docs as shown in `README.md`.
