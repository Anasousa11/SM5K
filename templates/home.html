        <h2>About Paul Ola & SinMancha</h2>
        <p>SinMancha was born from one man's journey of redemption, resilience, and transformation. Founded by <strong>Paul Ola</strong>, a 28-year-old personal trainer and running coach, SinMancha represents more than just fitness—it's a community for people seeking second chances.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--accent-color); margin-top: 1.5rem;">The Name: SinMancha</h3>
        <p>After leaving gang life behind, Paul wanted to be completely unspotted from that world—unblemished, clean, and free from that past. <strong>"SinMancha"</strong> is Spanish for "unspotted" or "without stains," symbolizing redemption and the power to transform your life, no matter where you've come from. It's a promise: your past doesn't define you.</p>
        
        <h3 style="color: var(--accent-color); margin-top: 1.5rem;">Paul's Journey</h3>
        <p><strong>The Beginning:</strong> Paul grew up as a natural athlete. Scouts were watching him for football, and by 18, he'd already earned both his Level 2 and Level 3 Personal Training certifications. Everything seemed destined for success.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Turning Point:</strong> But life took a different turn. Caught up in street life, Paul found himself incarcerated. It was in prison that fitness became his lifeline. With nothing but his bodyweight, Paul did burpees and push-ups every single day—not for vanity, but to heal. Those exercises became a meditation, a way to reclaim his mind and body.</p>
        
        <p><strong>The Comeback:</strong> Upon release, Paul didn't just restart his life—he revolutionized it. He created running clubs and iconic fitness challenges like the legendary 1000 Burpee Challenge. These weren't just workouts; they were pathways to redemption for people like him.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Today:</strong> After 10 years of building community through fitness, Paul returned to professional personal training at 28, combining his street credibility with legitimate coaching expertise. He now leads SinMancha with a mission: to prove that your past doesn't define your future, and that fitness is the greatest healer.</p>
