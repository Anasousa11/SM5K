        <h2 class="about-hero-title">My Story</h2>
        <p class="about-hero-lead">Founded by <strong>Paul Ola</strong>, a 28-year-old personal trainer and running coach, SinMancha grew from a personal journey of redemption into a tight-knit running community. Paul combines hard-earned street experience with professional training to guide people toward transformation.</p>

        <p class="about-sub"><strong>The Beginning:</strong> Paul was a natural athlete from childhood. Scouts watched him for football, and by 18, he had earned both his Level 2 and Level 3 Personal Training certifications. Everything seemed destined for success.</p>

        <p class="about-sub"><strong>The Turning Point:</strong> But life took a different turn. Caught up in street life, Paul found himself incarcerated. It was in prison that fitness became his lifeline. With nothing but his bodyweight, Paul did burpees and push-ups every single day—not for vanity, but to heal. Those exercises became a meditation, a way to reclaim his mind and body.</p>

        <p class="about-sub"><strong>The Comeback:</strong> Upon release, Paul didn't just restart his life—he revolutionized it. He created running clubs and iconic fitness challenges like the legendary 1000 Burpee Challenge. These weren't just workouts; they were pathways to redemption for people like him.</p>

        <p class="about-sub"><strong>SinMancha & Our Mission:</strong> After 10 years of building community through fitness, Paul returned to professional personal training, combining his street credibility with legitimate coaching expertise. <strong>"SinMancha"</strong> means "unspotted" or "without stains" in Spanish—symbolizing redemption and the power to transform your life, no matter where you've come from. We believe in second chances, resilience, and using fitness as a tool for change. SinMancha provides structured training, supportive community, and opportunities for growth—both physical and personal.</p>
